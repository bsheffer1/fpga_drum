#FPGA Drum

This is the vivado project for a project I worked on in the winter of 2020. A floating point pipeline was used to solve the equations of motion for a 2D coupled oscillator on a Nexys4 DDR develop board to simulate the motions of a drum membrane. An audio signal was derived from this simulation in real time.
